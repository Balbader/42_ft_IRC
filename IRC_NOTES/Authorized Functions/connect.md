# connect
In C++ network programming, the `connect` function is a system call used in the context of TCP/IP or UDP/IP sockets. It is primarily used to establish a connection to a specified server from a client's socket. This function is crucial in client-server communication where the client needs to initiate a connection before data can be exchanged.

Here's how `connect` is typically used:

1. **Socket Creation**: The client first creates a socket using the `socket` function.

2. **Using `connect`**:
- The client then uses `connect` to establish a connection to a server.
- The server must be listening on the specified port and IP address for a connection to be established.

3. **Function Prototype**: The `connect` function in C++ (and C) typically has the following prototype:
```cpp
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```

- `sockfd`: The file descriptor of the client's socket.
- `addr`: A pointer to a `sockaddr` structure that contains the destination address and port number (i.e., the address of the server).
- `addrlen`: The size of the `addr` structure.

4. **Address Structure**:
- For an IPv4 connection, `addr` will point to a `sockaddr_in` structure (representing an internet address).
- This structure is set with the server's IP address and port number.

5. **Establishing a Connection**:
- For TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), `connect` initiates a three-way handshake with the server to establish a reliable connection.
- For UDP (User Datagram Protocol), although being connectionless, `connect` sets the default destination address and allows the use of functions like `send` and `recv` (instead of `sendto` and `recvfrom`), but no actual connection is made.

6. **Blocking Nature**:
- By default, `connect` is a blocking operation. It will block the client until the connection is successfully established or an error occurs.
- For non-blocking sockets, `connect` will initiate the connection and return immediately. The completion of the connection can be determined by using `select` or similar mechanisms.

7. **Error Handling**:
- `connect` returns 0 on successful connection.
- On failure, it returns -1, and the specific error code can be retrieved from `errno`.

`connect` is a fundamental function in network programming, particularly for client applications that need to communicate with servers over the internet or a local network. It is used in a wide range of applications, from web browsers to networked multiplayer games.
