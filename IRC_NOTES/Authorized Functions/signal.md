# signal
In C and C++ programming on Unix-like operating systems, the `signal` function is used to set up signal handlers. Signals are a form of inter-process communication used by the operating system to notify processes of certain events, like an attempt to divide by zero (`SIGFPE`), a segmentation fault (`SIGSEGV`), or an instruction to terminate (`SIGTERM`).

Hereâ€™s an overview of how the `signal` function is used:

1. **Purpose**: The `signal` function sets a signal handler for a specific signal. A signal handler is a function that is called when the process receives the specified signal.

2. **Function Prototype**: The `signal` function typically has the following prototype:
```cpp
sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);
```
- `signum`: The signal number (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`).
- `handler`: A pointer to the signal handling function or a constant like `SIG_IGN` (to ignore the signal) or `SIG_DFL` (to restore the default behavior).

3. **Signal Handling Function**:
- The signal handling function must have a specific signature: it takes an integer (the signal number) and returns void.
- When the signal occurs, the operating system interrupts the normal flow of the program to execute this function.

4. **Example Usage**:
```cpp
#include <signal.h>

void sigint_handler(int signum) {
	// Handle SIGINT(Ctrl+C)
}

int main() {
signal(SIGINT, siging_handler);
}
```

5. **Error Handling**:
- `signal` returns `SIG_ERR` in case of an error, and the specific error can be checked using `errno`.

6. **Considerations**:
- The behavior of `signal` can vary between Unix versions. The `sigaction` function provides more predictable behavior and is generally preferred for new applications.
- Some signals, like `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP`, cannot be caught, ignored, or handled.
- Signal handlers should be as simple and quick as possible, and they should avoid non-reentrant functions (like `malloc` and `printf`).

7. **Use in Multithreaded Applications**:
- Signal handling in multithreaded applications can be complex. The `pthread_sigmask` and `sigwait` functions are often used in these scenarios.

In summary, `signal` in C and C++ is a fundamental mechanism for handling asynchronous events (signals) sent by the operating system or other processes. Proper handling of signals is crucial for writing robust applications, especially in systems programming and server-side applications.
