# accept
In C++ (and C) network programming, the `accept` function is a system call used in the context of a TCP server to accept a new connection from a client. When using TCP, the communication is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection must be established between the client and server before data can be exchanged. The `accept` function is part of this connection establishment process.

Here's how the `accept` function typically fits into a server's workflow:

1. **Socket Creation**: First, the server creates a socket using the `socket` function.

2. **Bind**: The server binds the socket to a specific port number on the local machine using the `bind` function. This step is necessary for the server to specify on which network interface and port it should listen for incoming connections.

3. **Listen**: The server calls the `listen` function on the socket to mark it as a passive socket, one that will be used to accept incoming connection requests.

4. **Accept**: Finally, the server uses the `accept` function to accept an incoming connection request. The `accept` function blocks the server until a client connects. Once a client attempts to make a connection, `accept` establishes the connection and returns a new socket specifically for this connection. This new socket is used for communication with the connected client, while the original listening socket continues to listen for new connections.

The prototype of the `accept` function is generally as follows:

```cpp
int accept(int sockfd, structc sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```

- `sockfd`: The file descriptor of the listening socket.
- `addr`: A pointer to a `sockaddr` structure. This structure will be filled with the address (IP and port) of the connecting entity.
- `addrlen`: A pointer to a `socklen_t` variable. Initially, this variable should be set to the size of the `addr` structure. `accept` will then set this variable to the actual size of the address that was stored in `addr`.

The `accept` function is a crucial part of TCP server programming. It allows the server to handle multiple clients by creating a new socket for each client connection, enabling the server to maintain a separate communication channel with each client.
