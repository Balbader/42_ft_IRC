# inet_ntoa
`inet_ntoa` is a function in C and C++ used in network programming, particularly in the context of IPv4 networking. It's part of the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) sockets API and is included in the `<arpa/inet.h>` header file on Unix-like systems. The function is used to convert an IPv4 address from its numeric binary representation in network byte order to the standard dot-decimal notation (e.g., "192.168.1.1").

The function signature of `inet_ntoa` is as follows:
```cpp
#include <arpa/inet.h>

char *inet_ntoa(struct in_addr in);

```

- **`in`**: A `struct in_addr` structure that contains an IPv4 address in network byte order.
- **`return`**: The function returns a C-style string (a pointer to a character array) representing the IPv4 address in dot-decimal notation.

### Usage:

`inet_ntoa` is commonly used when you need to display an IPv4 address in a human-readable format, especially in socket programming for debugging, logging, or displaying connection information.

### Example:

Here's a simple example showing how `inet_ntoa` might be used:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

int main() {
    struct in_addr ipAddr;
    ipAddr.s_addr = htonl(0xC0A80101); // Equivalent to 192.168.1.1 in hexadecimal

    char* ipStr = inet_ntoa(ipAddr);

    std::cout << "The IP address is: " << ipStr << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```
In this example:

- An `in_addr` structure is declared and its `s_addr` member is set using `htonl` (host to network long) to convert the hexadecimal representation of the IP address to network byte order.
- `inet_ntoa` is then used to convert this network byte order representation into a human-readable string in dot-decimal notation.
- The converted IP address is printed to the console.

### Important Notes:

- **Non-Thread Safe**: `inet_ntoa` returns a pointer to a static buffer that is overwritten with each call to the function. This makes it non-thread-safe. If you need to use the address string after subsequent calls to `inet_ntoa` or in a multi-threaded environment, you should copy the string to a separate buffer.
- **IPv4 Only**: The function only supports IPv4 addresses. For IPv6, the `inet_ntop` function is used.
- **Deprecation**: Like `inet_addr`, `inet_ntoa` is considered somewhat outdated in modern network programming in favor of `inet_ntop`, which supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and is thread-safe.
