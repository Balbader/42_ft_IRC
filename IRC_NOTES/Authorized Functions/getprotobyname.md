# getprotobyname
`getprotobyname` is a function in C and C++ used in network programming for retrieving protocol information. It is part of the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard, commonly used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The function takes a protocol name (as a string) and returns information about the specified protocol.

Here's how `getprotobyname` is typically used:

1. **Purpose**: The function is used to get the protocol number for a given protocol name. This is useful when setting up socket connections where you need to specify the protocol number in the socket call or for other network operations.
    
2. **Function Prototype**:
```cpp
struct protoent *getprotobyname(const char *name);
```

- `name`: The name of the protocol (e.g., "tcp" for TCP, "udp" for UDP).
- The function returns a pointer to a `protoent` structure, which contains the details of the protocol.

3. **The `protoent` Structure**: This structure typically contains at least the following members:
- `char *p_name`: The official name of the protocol.
- `char **p_aliases`: A NULL-terminated array of alternative names for the protocol.
- `int p_proto`: The protocol number.

4. **Usage Example**:
```cpp
struct protoent *proto;
proto = getprotobyname("tcp");
if (proto) {
	printf("Protocol name: %s, Protocol number: %d\n", proto->p_name, proto->p_proto);
} else {
	// Error handling
}

```

In this example, `getprotobyname` is used to retrieve information about the TCP protocol.

5. **Thread Safety**: It's important to note that `getprotobyname` may return a pointer to a statically allocated object, which can be overwritten by subsequent calls to the same function. This makes it unsafe for concurrent use in multithreaded programs without additional synchronization mechanisms.

6. **Error Handling**: If the protocol name is not found, `getprotobyname` returns a NULL pointer, so itâ€™s important to check the return value before using it.

`getprotobyname` is a lower-level, system-oriented function that's not as commonly used in high-level application programming as it once was, but it remains an integral part of the network programming toolkit in C and C++. In modern applications, protocol numbers are often handled automatically by higher-level networking libraries or frameworks, reducing the need to directly use `getprotobyname`.
