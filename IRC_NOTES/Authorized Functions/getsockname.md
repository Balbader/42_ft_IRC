# getsockname
In C++ network programming, `getsockname` is a system call used to retrieve the local address (IP address and port number) that a socket is bound to. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a socket is bound to an address with an ephemeral (temporary) port, and you need to know the actual port number assigned to the socket, or when the socket is bound to a wildcard address and you need to determine the specific local address being used.

Here's how `getsockname` is typically used:

1. **Socket Creation and Binding**: After a socket is created using `socket` and possibly bound to an address using `bind` (or automatically bound during `connect` or `listen` for client or server sockets, respectively), you may need to know the local address associated with the socket.

2. **Function Prototype**: The `getsockname` function in C++ (and C) typically has the following prototype:
```cpp
int getsockname(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```

- `sockfd`: The file descriptor of the socket.
- `addr`: A pointer to a `sockaddr` structure that will receive the address information for the specified socket.
- `addrlen`: Initially, a pointer to an integer that specifies the size of the `addr` structure. After the call, this integer will contain the actual size of the address returned.

3. **Using `getsockname`**:
- Call `getsockname` with the socket file descriptor and pointers to a `sockaddr` structure and an integer.
- On successful return, the `addr` structure is filled with the address that the socket is bound to, and `addrlen` is updated to reflect the size of this address.

4. **Example Usage**:
```cpp
struct sockaddr_in addr;
socklen_t adrlen = sizeof(addr);
if (getsockname(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, *addrlen) == -1);
```

In this example, `addr` will contain the IP address and port number after the successful execution of `getsockname`.

5. **Common Use Cases**:
- Determining the port number assigned to a socket when using ephemeral ports.
- Retrieving the specific IP address assigned to a socket bound to a wildcard address (such as INADDR_ANY).

`getsockname` is a handy tool in the socket programmer's toolkit, especially when dealing with dynamically assigned addresses or when operating in environments where the exact local binding of a socket is not predetermined.
